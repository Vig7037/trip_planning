# Trip Planning LLM Model for Uttarakhand

This project leverages the NVIDIA NIM platform and the Llama3-70b-instruct model to provide personalized trip planning for Uttarakhand. By using advanced AI techniques, the model generates detailed itineraries based on user inputs such as destination and duration.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Trip Planning**: Utilizes Llama3 to generate accurate and insightful trip plans.
- **NVIDIA NIM Integration**: Implements NVIDIA Embeddings and ChatNVIDIA for enhanced performance and accuracy.
- **Real-time Document Retrieval**: Efficiently retrieves and processes documents to provide precise recommendations and contextually relevant information.
- **Streamlit Web Application**: User-friendly interface for seamless interaction and trip planning.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: `streamlit`, `langchain_nvidia_ai_endpoints`, `langchain_community`, `langchain_core`, `dotenv`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/uttarakhand-trip-planner.git
